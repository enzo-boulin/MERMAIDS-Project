# MERMAIDS-Project

This project focuses on the development of algorithms to detect earthquakes within time series data derived from underwater hydrophones.
It was carried out as part of the research term at Mines de Paris and supervised by Karin Sigloch (sigloch@geoazur.unice.fr) and Sébastien Bonnieux (bonnieux@geoazur.unice.fr) of the GéoAzur team at the CNRS campus in Sophia-Antipolis.

This repository contains the various codes used to complete this project.
The data required to run them is not public; it was provided to us by Sébastien Bonnieux (bonnieux@geoazur.unice.fr).

The file *info_events.csv* contains various details allowing for the localization of known earthquakes within the hard drive data.

See *[rapport.pdf](https://github.com/enzo-boulin/MERMAIDS-Project/blob/main/rapport.pdf)* to understand the project workflow and details.
